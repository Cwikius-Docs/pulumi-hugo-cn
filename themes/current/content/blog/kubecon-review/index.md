We had a fantastic time at KubeCon in San Diego. During KubeCon, the Pulumi team released two technology previews: [Pulumi Crosswalk for Kubernetes](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crosswalk/kubernetes/) and [Pulumi Query for Kubernetes](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-query-kubernetes).  

Crosswalk for Kubernetes is a set of common patterns compiled in playbooks for Kubernetes. The playbooks reduce the complex Kubernetes API syntax by providing sane defaults with idiomatic Kubernetes. Checkout a quick introduction to Crosswalk for Kubernetes in this [blog post](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/inside-crosswalk-for-kubernetes/).

[Sara Novotny](https://twitter.com/sarahnovotny) defined observability as *“the ability to ask of your system and learn from it”* during her [keynote](https://youtu.be/W_8MHdtrgZE) with [Liz Fong-Jones](https://twitter.com/lizthegrey). Query for Kubernetes enables observability programmatically by exposing resource processes through either batch or streaming queries. Learn more about Query for Kubernetes in our [blog post](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/query-kubernetes/).

To see both Crosswak and Query for Kubernetes in action, watch the demo video showcasing Pulumi watch mode, using the Crosswalk library to reduce Kubernetes boilerplate, and building, deploying and running private containers.

Pulumi engineers, [Erin Crengel](https://twitter.com/eckrengel) and Sean Holung, presented `Are You About to Break Prod? Acceptance Testing with Ephemeral Environments `

Addressing a packed room, they showed how to use ephemeral environments (short lived environments that mimic production) to automate testing. Kudos to the [CNCF](https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn) for making the presentation videos available quickly, you can watch Erin and Sean's presentation on YouTube.
