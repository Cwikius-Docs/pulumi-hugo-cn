At Pulumi, we work with companies that range in size from a few engineers to entire departments responsible for managing infrastructure.
A common pattern we have seen is that as companies grow in size and complexity, they often build internal portals on top of Pulumi to enable developers to self-service their infrastructure needs.

Pulumi provides several features to help you get your own developer portal off the ground faster:

* Custom project templates
* Pulumi Backstage plugin
* Pulumi's New Project Wizard

## Custom templates

[Custom templates](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-portals/templates) can provide your Pulumi organization with a centralized repository for all your cloud components, best practices, and configurations.
They allow your Pulumi team members to organize, discover, and deploy cloud resources with ease, all within the Pulumi platform or within your own integrations.

We support organizational templates on the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud.

## Backstage plugin

[Backstage](https://www.backstage.com) is an open-source framework for building developer portals.
Using the [Pulumi Backstage plugin](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-portals/backstage) you can create new Pulumi projects from your organization's custom templates, and you can run previews, updates, or [Deployments](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments) directly from your Backstage instance.

## New project wizard

Pulumi's [New Project Wizard](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/get-started/#new-project-wizard) can also leverage your organization's custom templates to automatically commit and deploy code for new Pulumi projects entirely from within your browser.
